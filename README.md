# RedRip-Java
A Java-based GUI alternative of [RedRip](https://github.com/Sven65/RedRip)

To use RedRip-Java, you need a imgur API key which you can get [here](https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps)

If there is no apps there, you can add one [here](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient), set the `Authorization type` to `Anonymous usage without user authorization`.

Once added, you can go back to the apps page and get the `Client ID` of the application which is what you use as your imgur key.
